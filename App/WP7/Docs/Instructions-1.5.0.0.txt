4.	Application Features

A splash screen will display while the calculator initializes.  Once the splash ends you will 
be at the main calculator tab (labeled "Hand").  The application consists of the following 
tabs:

*	Hand - For current pot odds/hand odds and hand simulation.
*	History - The ability to review hand history for a given engine.
*	Stats - Contains additional statistics, etc.
*	Hands - Some common starting hands to play.
*	Hole Odds - Odds for pocket pairs against various hands.
*	Options - With sub tabs: Hand History, Holdem Calculator, General.


5.	Main Tab

The main tab consists of the following areas:

*	5 pre-drawn game cards (burn cards have been removed), including the flop, turn 
and river.
*	Pot size text box, this can be changed by clicking on it.
*	Bet size text box, this can be changed by clicking on it.
*	Number of outs text box, as with the pot and bet size this can be changed.
*	Pot/Bet percentage label
*	Hand odds ratio label.
*	Flop/Turn/River percentage labels.
*	Hole cards (displayed)
*	New hand button. 

5.1	Pot Odds Calculator

By clicking the pot size textbox an input dialog is displayed.  You can enter a new value 
and click OK to accept or cancel to return to the previous one.  The same is true for the 
bet size textbox and outs textbox.  However, the total number outs will be adjusted to a 
max of 45/46/47 (depending on where you are in the hand) for outs greater than that 
amount, i.e. it's not possible to have more than 47 outs.

After entering any value the labels are adjusted accordingly:


1.	Pot size shows the pot to bet ratio for example, pot of 10 and bet of 1 is a 10:1 ratio.
2.	Bet size label is the maximum bet you can call based on your outs and the pot size.
3.	The hands odds label is your hand ratio showing how likely you are to draw to a hand 
with the number of outs selected.  For example with 4 outs, and precision set to 0, 
you are a 5:1 underdog to make your hand.
4.	The make flop label is the hand odds as a percentage, for example with 4 outs and 
being a 5:1 underdog you will make your hand on the flop 16% of the time.
5.	Similarly to the flop the turn shows how likely you are to make your hand by 
percentage.  Using the flop numbers you will make your hand 9% of the time.
6.	On the turn using the flop ratios you will make your hand 9% of the time.


When the percentage that you are likely to draw your out yields a positive expectation, 
the Flop, River or Turn percentage label will show a green back color.  If it is negative it 
will show as red.  This is an indicator that you will lose money in the long run so you in 
most cases should not continue betting.
      Similar to the hand odds back color the bet size textbox will be red if you the bet 
you need to make is more than the maximum that you can call.  For example with 4 outs 
and a Pot size of 500 with a bet to call of 125 you are a 5:1 underdog and will only hit 
your hand 16% of the time, with precision set to 0.  Your maximum callable bet is 82 so 
in this case you will lose money in the long run so the bet label would be red.  However, 
if the bet was less than or equal to 82 in the worst case you would break even so your 
expectation is at worst zero.  Any bet less than the maximum would show a green label.
      
5.2	Hand Simulations

The 5 pre-drawn cards, flop, turn and river and hole cards are generated based on a 
simulated deal.  A randomized set of cards is dealt every time the "New Hand" button is 
pressed.  Depending on the number of players dealt to, the default is 9, based on the 
menu setting; you will receive two consecutive cards or the first card and the n + 1 card.  
For example for a two player deal you receive card one and card 3.  

When the flop, turn and river are dealt a burn card is removed to simulate an actual 
Texas Hold'em game.  By simulating hands you can practice making decision based on 
your pot odds to see if your skills are getting better or worse.  For convenience a preview 
checkbox, in the Hand History options sub-tab, has been added.  If you do not want to 
simulate a card for card game check the "Preview" checkbox, in the Holdem Calculator 
sub tab for Options, to show all cards simultaneously.  On every hand thereafter, the flop, 
turn and river cards will be shown.  The cards can be clicked in order to reveal them, as a 
convenience by clicking the river card, all of the cards are revealed.
      
      
5.2.1	Generated Hand History

Handy history is saved to a file, by default it's "HoldemHandHistory_YYYY_MM_dd", 
located in "\Program Files\Texas Holdem Calculator\HandHistory\".  If necessary the 
location can be changed by setting the hand history directory in the Hand History sub-tab 
of the options menu.  Only one file per day is created in order to minimize the number of 
files on disk.  Every time a hand is generated, it is stored until application exit.  When the 
application closes the hand history is saved to the file, this includes previous history 
stored in the file.  As a convenience a ReplayEngine ( HandHistoryReplayEngine ) is 
created and made selectable in the "Selected Engine" dropdown of the Hand History 
sub-tab in the options menu.  However, there are no statistics since this is an auto-
generated hand.


5.3	Context Menu Options

The context menu can be seen by pressing and holding in any part of the application.  The 
menu structure is as follows:
 
1.	Exit. - Exits the application.
 

6.	Hand History Tab

The Texas Hold'em Calculator has the ability to playback hands from popular online 
poker sites or any file depending on the engine.  For this release you can playback hands 
from games you have played at both PokerStars and PokerStars.Net as well as the auto-
generated hands.  Although there is a Fulltilt Poker option, it is included for developers 
to use as a template.  The history tab contains the following areas:


*	5 game cards (as they appeared in the hand history), including the flop, turn and 
river.
*	Hole cards (displayed)
*	Game description with Tournament Id label appended.
*	Game Id label.
*	Date and time label.
*	Hand number, i.e. Hand 1 of 121, 39 for this game.
*	Navigation slider for reviewing any of the hands.
*	Skip to hand button for navigating to a specific hand.
*	Load button, for loading a single file or directory.
*	Stats button, for reviewing statistics for the current game and all hands combined.


   Clicking the "Load" button brings up a dialog where you can choose either a folder(s) 
or file(s).  The file dialog automatically selects folders and allows you to select any 
number of folders and files.  If the recursive search is on, see the options section under 
Hand History, when a folder is selected each file with the given filter type is checked for 
hand history detail depending on the engine selected, again in the options tab.  As a 
convenience the last loaded directory is stored for the next file load.  If any hand history 
is found the last hand is loaded and the hole cards are displayed.  If the preview 
checkbox, found in the Hand History options sub-tab, is selected the Flop/Turn/River are 
displayed as well.  The cards can be clicked in order to reveal them, as a convenience by 
clicking the river card; all of the cards are revealed. By using the navigation slider each 
hand history can be shown from first to last.  Clicking on the slider increments the hand 
by the skip value defined in the Hand History sub-tab of the options menu.  Alternatively 
you can use the scroll wheel or navigation pad to skip one hand at a time.  The "Skip To 
Hand" button allows you to navigate to a specific hand.  Currently the username is used 
to determine if the selected user won the hand.  If this is the case the "Stats" button will 
turn green.  By default you cannot click the "Stats" button until at least on hand history 
has been loaded.
   
The "Stats" button allows you to view current statistics from the current game and all 
games collectively.  You can view the following in the "Hand History Stats" window:
   
   
*	Amount won [Game]
*	Amount won [All]
*	Amount won per hand [Game]
*	Amount won per hand [All]
*	Amount won per hand [Won]
*	Hands won [Game]
*	Hands won [All]


The [Game] tag indicates the current game or tournament if that is the case.  Whereas the 
[All] is for every hand history that has been loaded.  Finally [Won] indicates this statistic 
is based on only winning hands.  Closing the window brings you back to the Hand 
History tab.
   
   
7.	Stats Tab

The stats tab offers two additional statistics that can come into consideration when 
playing Texas Hold'em.  Runner-runner odds and the chance that your hole hand, 
containing an Ace, is up against a bigger Ace.
      
7.1	  Runner-Runner Odds

This is simply the probability of making your hand with two consecutive outs being 
drawn.  You simply make sure the outs on the "Hand" tab are set appropriately.  For 
example with 4 outs you are a 179:1 underdog, with precision set to 0, to draw two 
consecutive outs to make your hand.


7.2	  Ace against a Bigger Kicker

This statistics is based on hole cards only.  Simply change the player's textbox by clicking 
and setting the appropriate number of players.  The textbox will automatically adjust to 
23 players if more are selected since it is impossible to deal to more with only 52 cards 
per deck.  After changing the number of outs, select your next whole card 2 - King and 
the probability, ratio and percent labels will automatically be calculated.  For example, 
a set of hole cards A2 with 9 players has a probability of .65 or 65% chance of facing an 
Ace with a larger kicker.
      
7.3	Pair against a Bigger Pair

This statistics is based on hole cards only.  Simple change the kicker dropdown box or 
the player textbox (number of players), to calculate the new value.  The static shows the 
probability that the pocket pair faces a bigger pair.  For a detailed explanation visit: 
Poker Probability: Pocket Pairs.  Currently Pma, (see previous link), is not used in the 
calculation, however, the statistics should be used as a guideline and are provided as-is.
      
      
8.	Hands Tab

The hands tab contains two sets of recommended hands based on David Sklansky's work.  
The default is the modified which shows a tighter set of hands versus the basic which is 
a list of all playable hands but not necessarily best in all positions.


9.	Hole Odds Tab

The Hold Odds tab shows a list of hole cards against various opposing hand rankings.  
For example a High pocket pair versus a lower is an 80.3% favorite to 19.7% underdog.  
These are useful in determining whether or not to call an All-In bet.


10.	Options Tab

There are three sub-tabs for options: "Holdem Calculator", "Hand History" and 
"General".


10.1	 Hand History

*	Selected Engine - Choose the hand replay engine to use.

11.	Replay Engine

	The Texas Hold'em Calculator has the ability to allow anyone to customize the 
way hand history is determined.  That is to say that anyone wishing to add a custom 
engine to the application can do so.  All that is required is following the ReplayEngine 
API.  For those wishing to do so, the Fulltilt and PokerStars Replay Engines can serve as a 
guide.  After creating the satellite assembly, simply drop it in the ReplayEngine 
directory.  This is "\Program Files\Texas Hold'em Calculator\ReplayEngineAssemblies\", 
by default.  However, the configuration, "Holdem.Configuration.dll.config" houses a key 
that defines where this directory, which can be changed.  The API will be described in 
full during future releases if any.

12.	Card Themes

	All card images can be changed by selecting the appropriate theme option in the 
Holdem Calculator sub-tab of the options menu.  These themes are located in the 
directory specified by the Theme Directory textbox; it can be changed if desired.  By 
default there is one embedded theme "Border" which is always displayed at the end of 
the list.  If no additional themes are available or if any images are missing for the 
selected theme the default ones will be used.

12.1	  Adding Custom Themes

	Adding a custom theme is simply a matter of adding images in a static directory 
structure using static image names.  For example, adding a theme named "Smoke" 
needs to have a directory named "Smoke" in the Theme folder, if the theme directory is 
"Program Files/Texas Holdem Calculator/CardThemes" then add a top level folder:

"Program Files/Texas Holdem Calculator/CardThemes/Smoke"

The following directories may be added depending on the desired image to update:

*	"Program Files/Texas Holdem Calculator/CardThemes/Smoke/Backs"
*	"Program Files/Texas Holdem Calculator/CardThemes/Smoke/Club"
*	"Program Files/Texas Holdem Calculator/CardThemes/Smoke/Diamond"
*	"Program Files/Texas Holdem Calculator/CardThemes/Smoke/Hands"
